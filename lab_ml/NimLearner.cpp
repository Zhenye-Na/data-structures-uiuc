 * game of Nim with vertex labels "p#-X", where:
 * - # is the current player's turn; p1 for Player 1, p2 for Player2
 * - X is the tokens remaining at the start of a player's turn
 *
 * For example:
 *   "p1-4" is Player 1's turn with four (4) tokens remaining
 *   "p2-8" is Player 2's turn with eight (8) tokens remaining
 *
 * All legal moves between states are created as edges with initial weights
 * of 0.
 *
 * @param startingTokens The number of starting tokens in the game of Nim.
